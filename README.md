Illustrations wonderfully crafted by Natalie Tan.

[Sarah Drasner's article on CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/) was a valuable resource for getting me started. It also provided me with perspective on design decisions on topics such as managing contrast (though in this theme's case I took plenty of liberties).

Last but not least, kudos to the Telltale team for putting together this memorable series (it's been almost eight years!) â€” and of course, the creators of _Fables_ for inspiring them in the first place.
